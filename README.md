## Summary

The `App` function is a React component that manages a savings tracker application. It handles state for currencies, income, expenses, tax rates, and modal interactions for adding or editing financial items. The component uses local storage to persist data and recalculates savings whenever relevant data changes.

## Example Usage

```javascript
// To use the App component, simply render it within a React application.
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## Code Analysis

### Flow

1. Initializes state variables for managing currency, income, expenses, and modal properties.
2. Uses `useEffect` to load initial state from local storage when the component mounts.
3. Another `useEffect` recalculates the monthly savings whenever `currency`, `taxRate`, `income`, or `expenses` change.
4. Provides functions to handle user interactions such as changing currency, adding/updating items, and opening/closing the modal.
5. Renders the UI elements including forms for input, lists of income and expenses, and buttons for adding and editing items.

### Outputs

- Renders a user interface that allows users to track their income and expenses in different currencies, calculate monthly savings, and manage tax rates.
- Provides interactive elements to add, edit, or delete income and expense items.
